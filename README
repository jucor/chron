This directory contains code and help for an R port of CHRON, an S-PLUS
package for working with chronological objects (times and dates).

The original was downloaded from
  http://netlib.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/departments/sia/project/misc/chron.html
See the file `PORTING' for the changes made for the R version.

See `Y2K' for information on the year 2000 update.

The original `README' is appended below.

*** Original README **************************************************

This directory contains S functions to work with chron objects. These
objects handle dates and times. For the time being issues relating to 
time-zones, daylight savings time, etc. are being put aside.

NOTE: To use chron objects you need library(statistics) in S.
      In S-PLUS you need library(chron, first = T)

For source and details, see

	http://cm.bell-labs.com/ms/departments/sia/dj/chron.html

The following methods and functions are available for chron objects:

function	description
----------	-----------------------------------------------------
chron		createas a chron object; it takes either julian dates
		or character dates. See help(chron).
dates		creates a dates object (simply invokes chron)
times		creates a times object (simply inoveks chron)

as.numeric	returns a vector of julian dates + fraction of day (times)
as.character	returns a character representation of dates/times
is.na

print		print dates and times nicely 
plot		plot with time axis
hist		histogram with time axis
identify	identify points in scatterplot
lines, points	add lines/points
axis.times	add time axis to plot
cut		make ordered factors from dates (e.g., by month, week)
seq		generate a sequence of dates

min, max, 	numeric summaries
range, summary		
sort, order
trunc, ceiling,
round, signif,
diff

[.times		selects, e.g., dates[ dates > "02/20/92" ], or
		lathe.date[ start.date > min(scan.date) ]

[<-.times	replacement
c		combines chrons

days, months, 	extact day, month, year, quarter number, etc.
years, quarters		
weekdays,
hours, minutes, 
seconds
is.holiday
is.weekend

month.day.year 	date conversion (modified from the S "blue" book) 
julian,
day.of.week

UNDOCUMENTED FEATURES:
----------------------
	1. Chron matrices can be created from chron objects by using dim() 
	   (can't use matrix() nor array())
	   > dim(x) <- c(20,3)
	   > x[2,3] <- "03/28/90"	 # replaces a cell

	2. The c() method takes anything that can be coerced to chrons:
	   y <- c(x, "03/21/92", 8123)
	   but a bug(?) in the S evaluator makes it necessary to 
	   specify the chron object first, i.e., c("03/28/90", x) does not
	   dispath the c.dates() method.
